title: Google Summer of Code 2015
---

2015 marked [The Processing Foundation](http://processing.org)'s fifth year participating in [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/soc/).  Following is a summary of the 15 projects, in alphabetical order by project name, completed this summer by a terrific group of students.


### 1) [p5.js Windows Port](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-editor) by [Guy de Bree](https://github.com/Bruehausu), mentored by [Sam Lavigne](https://github.com/antiboredom)

![p5.js Editor Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/tL0GUAm.png)

For my Google Sumer of Code I developed a Windows port for the p5.js IDE, and fixed bugs for said editor. It’s now on the p5.js website! While it still has bugs, you can try it out on [the downloads page](http://p5js.org/download/). ([source code](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-editor))

### 2) New Kinect libraries [openKinect](https://github.com/shiffman/OpenKinect-for-Processing) and [KinectPV2] (https://github.com/ThomasLengeling/KinectPV2) by [Thomas Sanchez Lengeling](http://codigogenerativo.com/), mentored by [Elie Zananiri](http://dpt.co/)


![Examples of the libraries updates](http://codigogenerativo.com/wp-content/uploads/Kinect_final.png)

The goal of the project was to expand and update the existing Kinect libraries; OpenKinect-for-Processing and KinectPV2. The openKinect library now supports the new Kinect v2 for Mac and Windows and Kinect v1 for Windows and Linux. For the KinectPV2, functionalities include: skeleton tracking, face detection, process frame raw data, point cloud extraction and contour extraction. Source Code on github: [OpenKinect-for-Processing](https://github.com/shiffman/OpenKinect-for-Processing) and [KinectPV2](https://github.com/ThomasLengeling/KinectPV2).

### 3) [Processing.py 3.0 Update](https://github.com/Luxapodular/processing.py) by [Luca Damasco](https://github.com/Luxapodular), mentored by [Golan Levin](https://github.com/golanlevin)

![Processing.py Mock Image](http://i.imgur.com/mVybW32m.png)

Prior to the start of the Google Summer of Code, Processing’s Python mode would not work at all with Processing 3.0 do to some extensive back end changes. Fortunately, this summer saw the revitalization and updating of Python Mode! Users may now write Processing 3.0 Sketches using Python syntax in the new editor. Due to a few outstanding bugs, it has not yet been officially released, but feel free to try it out by building the [Processing.py Source](https://github.com/Luxapodular/processing.py) on your own machine. In addition to once again making Python Mode functional, I have edited over 1000 lines of reference code as well as ported 9 new tutorials! [Feel free to check them out and leave feedback!](https://github.com/Luxapodular/processing-py-site) 

### 4) [Web IDE for p5.js](https://github.com/therewasaguy/p5js-webIDE) by [Jason Sigal](http://jasonsigal.cc), mentored by [Daniel Shiffman](http://shiffman.net/)

![p5 web ide screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/yKAxxMD.png)

A browser-based code editor, designed specifically for the p5.js community. The project adapts the p5.js Desktop IDE (originally by Sam Lavigne, GSOC '14) for the web, with inspiration/insight from Gene Kogan's p5 Sandbox. The goal is to make it easy to create, browse, share, and remix creative code sketches directly from the browser. Every project gets a unique URL and version control (through GitHub Gists). Logged-in users can access their previous sketches, and all users can access curated p5.js examples. Create an account and start sketching! Demo at [p5ide.herokuapp.com](http://p5ide.herokuapp.com/).

### 5) Raspberry Pi and armv7hf support by [Gottfried Haider](http://gottfriedhaider.com/), mentored by Ben Fry

Gottfried worked on making Processing play well with the Raspberry Pi and similar ARM-powered *microcomputers* (to borrow a term used in the 1970s to describe various kits and designs built around affordable microprocessors, such as the Motorola 6800).

Initial support got [merged](https://github.com/processing/processing/commits/master?author=gohai) into processing.git in time for Processing 3.0. The upcoming 3.0.1 release will contain all remaining parts, such as the bits necessary for having working OpenGL graphics on the Pi (with some great help by the JOGL team).

Part of the work also involved the creation of a new core library, [Hardware I/O](https://processing.org/reference/libraries/io/index.html), that was made to provide access to the hardware peripherals, such as GPIO, I2C and SPI, that are generally made available on pin headers on such systems. The hope was that using those could be as simple and straightforward as it is on the Arduino platform today.

To learn more: Notes about running [Processing on ARM Linux](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/ARM-Linux) and the [Raspberry Pi & Raspberry Pi 2](https://github.com/processing/processing/wiki/Raspberry-Pi). A short (vertical!) [video clip](https://vimeo.com/131480032) showing the GPIOs in action.

### 6) [p5.SVG](https://github.com/zenozeng/p5.js-svg) and [p5.PDF](https://github.com/zenozeng/p5.js-pdf) by [Zeno Zeng](https://github.com/zenozeng), mentored by [Danne Woo](https://github.com/dannewoo)

The main goal of p5.SVG is to provide a SVG runtime for p5.js, so that we can draw using p5's powerful API in \<svg\>, save things to svg file and manipulating existing SVG file without rasterization.

Source code on GitHub: https://github.com/zenozeng/p5.js-svg

As for p5.PDF, it's a simple PDF export module for p5.js based on browser's print to pdf function.

### 7) [internationalization of p5.js website](https://github.com/mayaman/p5js-website) & [collection of sketches for the p5.js community statement video](https://github.com/mayaman/p5jsCommunitySketches) by [Maya Man](https://github.com/mayaman/), mentored by [Johanna Hedva](http://www.johannahedva.com/)

This summer, I worked primarily on two separate projects. First, I rebuilt the p5.js (currently built in php) using Node.js, Assemble, Grunt, Handlebars, & YAML to support internationalization (easy tranlations from English to foreign languages // button styling to be adjusted & tranlsations to be completed at upcoming translat-a-thons). Second, I collected and currated sketches contributed from people around the world to play in the background our p5.js community statement video. Check out the projects on my github (source code below)!

### 8) Contribution Manager UI upgrade by [Akarshit Wal](https://github.com/Akarshit), mentored by [Scott Murray](https://github.com/alignedleft)

Contribution Manager is a tool which lets uers install/upgrade/remove various libraries and other contributions. The aim of the project was to change UI of the Contribution Manager and make it more user-friendly. The Contribution Manager looks like this now -  
![Contribution Manager](http://i.imgur.com/TuEATTb.png)  
There are icons indicating the status of every contribution in the first column of the list.
There is separate tab showing contributions which need upgradation.  
![Updates tab](http://i.imgur.com/2kIC0EJ.png)  
User can also search contributions based on a filter.

Another small part of the project was to test all the libraries and their examples to check their compatibility with Processing 3.0 and collect data about what is missing in them.
  
### 9) [RSyntaxTextArea integration](https://github.com/joelmoniz/processing/tree/RSTA) and the [REPL Mode](https://github.com/joelmoniz/REPLmode) by [Joel Moniz](http://joelmoniz.com/), mentored by [Manindra Moharana](http://www.mkmoharana.com/)

* RSyntaxTextArea integration  
  
  The RSyntaxTextArea integration aimed at replacing the JEditTextArea, which is currently at heart of the PDE editor, with the [RSyntaxTextArea](https://github.com/bobbylight/RSyntaxTextArea) and the complementary [AutoComplete](https://github.com/bobbylight/AutoComplete) code completion library to bring several new features to the table, such as code folding and documentation support and parameter tabbing during auto-completion.  
Here's a screenshot of the PDE after integration:
  
  ![The PDE with RSyntaxTextArea and AutoComplete](https://joelmoniz.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/rsta_fold_doc.png)
  
* REPL Mode  
  
  This mode adds a Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop console to processing, enabling users to type in processing code and to view the output of this code immediately. This mode also gives the PDE the ability to hot swap code, wherein the output corresponding to changes made in a running sketch can be viewed by simply saving the sketch, without restarting it. Here's a screengrab of the REPL Mode in action:

### 15) p5bots by [Sarah Groff-Palermo](http://sarahgp.com/), mentored by Shawn van Every

![Graph of p5bots system](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sarahgp/p5bots/master/img/how-it-works.png)

p5bots combines a socket layer and a simplified API to enable users to interact with an Arduino (or other microprocessor) from within the browser. Use sensor data to drive a sketch; use a sketch to to affect the real world.

### 16) p5 WebGL Renderer by [Karen Peng](http://karenlabs.com), mentored by [Kevin Siwoff](http://http://kevinsiwoff.com/)

![p5 webGL renderer](http://imgur.com/wK0hJe1.jpg)

 A light-weight webGL renderer for p5.js. Now is already part of p5.js.
 
 Over the summer, basic webGL APIs for p5.js are implemented. It enables you to create sketches under WebGL mode, while all the syntaxes remain consistent with p5 2D (default) mode.
 
 WebGL APIs includes: cameras, geometries, lights, materials, texture, etc. For more detial, [references](http://p5js.org/reference/) are documented. Get started with p5 webGL [tutorial](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Getting-started-with-WebGL-in-p5). Take a look at 3D [examples](http://p5js.org/examples/).
